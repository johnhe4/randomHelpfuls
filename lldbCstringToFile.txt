This was helpful when I needed to print the contents of a std::vector<uint8_t> named '_bigBuffer' to a file. 

First, null-terminate the vector if not already null terminated.

Second, up the value of the read size in LLDB. I chose a value of 100000 because I knew the approximate size of the vector.

Finally, read the memory and save to a file

In LLDB:
$> expr _bigBuffer.push_back(0)
$> setting set target.max-string-summary-length 100000
$> memory read -fs --outfile ~/debug.json  --force _bigBuffer.data() _bigBuffer.data()+_bigBuffer.size()

You can get more info by typing:
$> help memory read

For the various options, you can get info by not specifying values, for example '-f' without a number will print info for formats.
